   <b> Information about loans:</b> Not all lenders can provide loan amounts up to $50,000. The maximum amount you may borrow from any lender is determined by the lender based on its own policies, which can vary, and on your creditworthiness. The time to receive loan proceeds varies among lenders, and in some circumstances faxing of loan request form materials and other documents may be required. Submitting your information online does not guarantee that you will be approved for a loan. </p>
<p  style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 22px;">
Every lender has its own terms and conditions and renewal policy, which may differ from lender to lender. You should review your lender's terms and renewal policy before signing the loan agreement. Late payments of loans may result in additional fees or collection activities, or both. We do not control the amount of fees or charges you may owe for nonpayment, late payment, or partial payment. Ask your lender for more information. </p>
